*** Test Cases ***

P(x)				Reason
====================================================
x^2				Typical input
2x^4				Typical input
x^2 + 2x + 1			Typical input
x^4 + x^3 - 2			Typical input
2x^3 + 1			Typical input
100x^5 + 50x^4 + x^3 + 2x^2	Large polynomial
2x				Linear polynomial
4				Constant polynomial
x^1000 + 4			Sparse polynomial
0				Zero polynomial

Note: These polynomials are the same ones that are in the input file.
The results of the operations tested can be found in the output file. All results were as expected.
You may reproduce the output by using the command PolynomialTester < input.txt > output.txt
